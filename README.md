# Consistant Frame Caping
Use RTSS for framerate caping over build-in game engines caps. RTSS is the best in frametime consistancy. Do not use a higher cap value than 190 FPS since the game will introduce stutter (its a apex bug) You can download RTSS [here](https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/rtss-rivatuner-statistics-server-download.html)
